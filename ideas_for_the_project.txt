Basics:  given a repository, user, and branch (default to master), list that
user's activity on that repository.

Future neatness:
 - Match up email address on Github with email address on Facebook so you could
   see wall posts saying "Jon made a commit to NeatoRepository" where "Jon"
   links to Jon's profile on Facebook and "NeatoRepository" links to the Github
   page for that repository.  "Commit" could link to the specific revision.
   
 - See alerts on Facebook that someone else commited to one of your repositories
   so you should do a pull.
   
 - Settings page to toggle what gets posted to your wall, what alerts you see.
